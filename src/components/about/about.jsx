                My interest in technology was sparked during my time at Securitas Technology, where I was introduced to security systems and technology.
                This experience ignited a passion for tech and problem-solving, and I realized that software development was a field I wanted to pursue.
                To deepen my understanding and skills, I made the decision to go back to school in 2024 to focus on coding and expand my knowledge in software development, web security, and front-end technologies.

                Since then, Iâ€™ve been fully committed to learning and honing my skills in the MERN stack, front-end development, and creating user-friendly, efficient solutions.
                Iâ€™m excited to apply my knowledge in real-world projects, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and continue growing in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
                Technology excites me because itâ€™s always changing, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute and make an impact in the digital world.
